Added Geo Rocks, Soul Totems, Lifeblood Cocoons, Grimmkin Flames and Boss Essence to the item list, as well as Focus in cursed mode.

Added a Toggle Benches button, which will fade out all rooms except for bench rooms 
 - rooms that can be reached from a bench, itemless, with access to all MSJP items but without passing through randomized transitions.
This will include the starting location if it correctly appears in the tracker log.

Added a Toggle Helper Locations button, which will fade out all rooms which do not have checks/transitions in the helper log.

Separated out the following disconnected rooms into two parts:
   Deepnest_East_07 (-main, -isolated)
   Hive_01 (-main, -isolated)
   Hive_03 (-main, -isolated)
   Abyss_09 (-main, -isolated)
   Ruins1_05 (-main, -lower)
   Ruins1_18 (-main, -isolated)
   Ruins1_24 (-upper, -lower)
   Ruins2_03 (-main, -isolated)
   Fungus3_48 (-upper, -lower)
   White_Palace_05 (-upper, -lower)

Combined the following rooms into one part (city elevators):
   Crossroads_49, Crossroads_49b -> Crossroads_49-both
   Ruins2_10, Ruins2_10b -> Ruins2_10-both
I didn't think it was necessary to join the corresponding areas for area rando because there aren't too many areas. I didn't
think it was necessary to join the tram rooms because if you have access to the tram, having the rooms be joined isn't helpful.

Separated the following areas from the main parts:
   Hive-grub from Hive
   Kingdom's Edge-lurker from Kingdom's Edge

Moved certain items to appear in the natural room:
   World Sense in Room_temple
   Dream Nail in RestingGrounds_04
   Charm Notch-Colosseum in Room_Colosseum_01
   Pale Ore-Colosseum in Room_Colosseum_01
   Nailmaster's Glory in Room_shop
   Grey Prince Zote in Room_Bretta

Added a statistics tab to show a few statistics about rooms/areas explored. Rooms/areas will only be considered explored if
at least one transition to/from that area has been explored; this matters mainly for Dirtmouth stag station.
The statistics tab will also show transitions from a selectable area.

To show descriptive room names, replace altroomnames.xml with descriptiveroomnames.xml in the Resources directory.

Removed some superfluous content from the items, areas and rooms xml files.
